# [DESIGN PATTERNS](#)

#### Design patterns are solutions to software design problems you find again and again in real-world application development. Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects. They are categorized in three groups: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

## [Creational Patterns](#)

### [Singleton Pattern](https://github.com/serhatyamann/DESIGN_PATTERNS/tree/master/Singleton_Pattern)

#### The Singleton design pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

### [Factory Method Pattern](https://github.com/serhatyamann/DESIGN_PATTERNS/tree/master/Factory_Method_Pattern)

#### The Factory Method design pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. This pattern lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
