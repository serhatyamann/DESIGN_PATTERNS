# DESIGN PATTERNS

#### Design patterns are solutions to software design problems you find again and again in real-world application development. Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects. They are categorized in three groups: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

## Creational Patterns

### [Singleton Pattern](https://github.com/serhatyamann/DESIGN_PATTERNS/tree/master/Singleton_Pattern)

#### The Singleton design pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

### [Factory Method Pattern](https://github.com/serhatyamann/DESIGN_PATTERNS/tree/master/Factory_Method_Pattern)

#### The Factory Method design pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. This pattern lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

## Structural Patterns

### [Decorator Pattern](https://github.com/serhatyamann/DESIGN_PATTERNS/tree/master/Decorator_Pattern)

#### The Decorator design pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. This pattern provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## Behavioral Patterns

### [Chain of Responsibility Pattern](https://github.com/serhatyamann/DESIGN_PATTERNS/tree/master/Chain_of_Responsibility_Pattern)

#### The Chain of Responsibility design pattern avoids coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. This pattern chains the receiving objects and passes the request along the chain until an object handles it.
