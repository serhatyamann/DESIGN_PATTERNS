## DESIGN PATTERNS

#### Design patterns are solutions to software design problems you find again and again in real-world application development. Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects. They are categorized in three groups: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

### Creational Patterns

The Singleton design pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
